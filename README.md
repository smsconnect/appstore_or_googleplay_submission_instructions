# appstore_or_googleplay_submission_instructions
*** Not really a repository, just instructions on how to submit applications to the Apple Appstore and the Google Play Store and instructions on how to find the files on the myshares server ***

##Apple Appstore Submission Process
####Required Components
1. A 'p12' **distribution** certificate (important that it is a **distribution** certificate if you are actually submitting to the appstore)

2. A password for the 'p12' (choose pass when you create the 'p12' cert...if you don't know the password and can't find it then you will have to make the 'p12' again --- I would recommend writing the passwords in a text file and storing on server because there is no way in god's lovely green smoky earth that you will remember the pass like a week after you make the certificate)

3. A **distribution** mobile provision file (important that it is a **distribution** mobile provision file if you are actually submitting to the appstore)

4. 'Splashscreens' that the user sees on iOS devices when the app is loading (**upload these on the Adobe AEMM portal before downloading 'ipa' file**)

5. An 'ipa' file (download from Adobe AEMM web portal)

6. A 'png' of the app icon that matches the resolution requirements of the Apple developer website (**has to be a png not a jpg!**, and has to be flattened png with no transparencies)

7. Screenshots of the app for each device resolution that Apple requires (take screenshots with available iOS devices and then use photoshop to crop to different device resolutions that we don't have --- [check here for specific device resolutions](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH26-SW2)
